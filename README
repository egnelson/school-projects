- Install a Fedora 20 vm
- in the vm, open a terminal
	- run 'su' and type in the root user's password
	- as root run 'yum install python3 python3-pip'
	- as root run 'python3-pip install django'
	- run 'exit'
	- run 'cd website'
	- run './manage.py runserver'
	- don't close the terminal

- Open up the web browser to "localhost:8000"
- There are jobs and users for each of the sample jobs you gave us.
- I made some dummy events for each of the employers as well.
- Before logging in, please test the search functionality. You can choose to search for jobs or events in the drop-down box to the left of the search bar. If you leave the text field empty, it will display all jobs or events.
- When you're done testing the search, go to localhost:8000/admin, login (username 'admin', password 'admin'), and click on 'Users' to view all the users. All but one (asdf) is an employer.
- Each user's password is the same as the username (of course, I wouldn't do this in a live website).
- Go ahead and log in as one of the employers (any except admin or asdf). 
- Play around with the jobs and events- you can create, view, edit, and delete jobs and events.
- Log out, then log back in as 'asdf' (password 'asdf')
- asdf should be following no jobs or events
- Search for a job or event and click on a view link
- At the bottom of the job/event table, there should be a button that says 'Watch'. Click on it. This creates a row in the WatchedJob (or WatchedEvent) table, and redirects back to the home page. You should see a new entry in the watched job (or event) list.

WHAT I IMPLEMENTED
- Employer: can create, update, delete jobs.
- job seeker (signed in): can view, watch and unwatch jobs
- job seeker (anonymous): can view jobs
- job seeker: can view employer info (partial- no way other than knowing correct url)

IMPLEMENTED EXTRA CREDIT 
- Events and related employer functionality (create, update, delete)
- Job seeker- watch/unwatch events
- sign up and login for job seekers and employers
- Administration site
- Job and event search

WHAT I IMPLEMENTED THAT WASN'T IN THE PROPOSAL
- A searching function that appears on most pages when an applicant is browsing.

WHAT I DIDN'T IMPLEMENT FULLY
- Job seeker: view employer info pages- There are no links anywhere to the public employer pages, so only someone who knew the correct url would be able to view them.

WHAT SHOULD HAVE BEEN IN THE PROPOSAL
- Search function: there was no way to discover jobs and events in the original proposal. This is an important function of a job website, and I overlooked it.
